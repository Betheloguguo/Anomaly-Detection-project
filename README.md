# Fraud Detection Project

## Overview

This project aims to detect fraudulent transactions in mobile money operations using machine learning. It leverages a synthetic dataset generated by PaySim, which simulates real-world financial transactions and fraud scenarios. The workflow covers data exploration, cleaning, feature engineering, handling class imbalance, model building, evaluation, and interpretation.

## Dataset

- **Source:** Synthetic data from PaySim, based on real mobile money logs.
- **File:**  
  - PS_20174392719_1491204439457_log.csv
- **Features:**  
  - `step`: Time step (hourly)  
  - `type`: Transaction type (CASH-IN, CASH-OUT, DEBIT, PAYMENT, TRANSFER)  
  - `amount`: Transaction amount  
  - `nameOrig`, `nameDest`: Sender and receiver IDs  
  - `oldbalanceOrg`, `newbalanceOrig`, `oldbalanceDest`, `newbalanceDest`: Account balances  
  - `isFraud`: Indicates fraudulent transaction  
  - `isFlaggedFraud`: Indicates flagged illegal attempts

## Data Exploration & Cleaning

- Inspected data structure, missing values, and feature distributions.
- Noted that merchant accounts (IDs starting with 'M') have limited information and were filtered out for modeling.
- Removed high-cardinality features (`nameOrig`, `nameDest`) and irrelevant columns.
- Converted target variable (`isFraud`) to integer type.

## Feature Engineering

- Scaled numerical features using `StandardScaler`.
- Encoded categorical features (`type`) using `OneHotEncoder`.
- Combined scaled and encoded features for modeling.

## Handling Imbalanced Data

- The dataset is highly imbalanced, with far fewer fraudulent transactions.
- Used SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to balance the training data before model building and feature selection.

## Model Building

- Split data into training and testing sets.
- Built models using Decision Tree and Random Forest classifiers.
- Used pipelines for preprocessing and modeling.
- Trained models on resampled (balanced) data.

## Evaluation

- Evaluated models using classification report (precision, recall, f1-score) and confusion matrix.
- Visualized confusion matrix and feature importances.
- Visualized the decision tree structure for interpretability.

## Feature Selection

- Used tree-based feature importance (Gini importance) from Decision Tree/Random Forest, which is robust to class imbalance.
- Visualized feature importances to interpret model decisions.

## Observations

- **Imbalanced Data:** Fraudulent transactions are rare, making recall and precision critical metrics.
- **Feature Importance:** Transaction type and amount are strong predictors of fraud.
- **Model Performance:** Tree-based models handle imbalance better and provide robust feature importance.
- **Data Limitations:** Merchant accounts lack balance information, so they were excluded from analysis.

This project demonstrates a practical workflow for fraud detection using machine learning, highlighting the importance of handling imbalanced data and careful feature selection. The approach can be adapted to real-world financial datasets for improved fraud prevention.
