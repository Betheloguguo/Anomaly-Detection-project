# Fraud Detection Project

## Overview

This project analyzes a synthetic financial transactions dataset generated by PaySim, simulating mobile money operations and fraudulent activities. The goal is to build and evaluate machine learning models for detecting fraudulent transactions.

## Dataset

- **Source:** Synthetic data from PaySim, based on real mobile money logs.
- **Features:** Includes transaction type, amount, sender/receiver IDs, balances, and fraud indicators.
- **Imbalance:** The dataset is highly imbalanced, with far fewer fraudulent transactions than legitimate ones.

## Approach

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Inspected data structure, missing values, and feature distributions.
   - Noted that merchant accounts (IDs starting with 'M') have limited information and were filtered out for modeling.

2. **Data Cleaning:**
   - Removed high-cardinality features (e.g., sender/receiver IDs).
   - Converted target variable (`isFraud`) to integer type.

3. **Feature Engineering & Selection:**
   - Scaled numerical features.
   - Used statistical tests and tree-based methods (Random Forest) for feature selection.
   - Addressed class imbalance using SMOTE for oversampling.

4. **Modeling:**
   - Built baseline models using Logistic Regression and Random Forest.
   - Used pipelines for preprocessing and modeling.
   - Evaluated models with precision, recall, and confusion matrix.

## Observations

- **Imbalanced Data:** Fraudulent transactions are rare, making recall and precision critical metrics.
- **Feature Importance:** Transaction type and amount are strong predictors of fraud.
- **Model Performance:** Tree-based models (Random Forest) handle imbalance better and provide robust feature importance.
- **Data Limitations:** Merchant accounts lack balance information, so they were excluded from analysis.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates a practical workflow for fraud detection using machine learning, highlighting the importance of handling imbalanced data and careful feature selection. The approach can be adapted to real-world financial datasets for improved fraud prevention.
